              <p>Nu Alpha Phi, Epsilon Chapter, was founded by five asian male students of various backgrounds. As a result of the lack of unity and pride common among students of NYU-Poly, these five men emerged together and embarked on a mission to further enhance the college experience for themselves and their peers. These men fully accepted the responsibilities of creating the founding class of Epsilon Chapter at NYU-Poly.</p>

              <p>Eugene Eng, Bailey Peng, Regis Tsai, Tyler Yao, and Peter Yu, worked together through a tried and true educational process which taught them the dedication and virtues which would guide them through life.</p>

              <p>In May 14, 2000, Mammoth, Rage, Bounce, Shock, and Method, established the Epsilon Alpha class, thereby creating the first Asian-interest fraternity to exist in NYU-Poly. Following the example of those preceding them, they accepted the task of expanding Nu Alpha Phi and what it stands for, to NYU-Poly and to the world.</p>

            <div id="mission" class="content-text">
              <p>After being incorporated in the Summer of '96, Nu Alpha Phi Fraternity, Inc. assumes the legitimate body of a national corporation. Along with this venture, comes responsibilities and goals that we, as a part of this corporation must fulfill and uphold to make this Fraternity grow bigger and stronger and and become a more prominent body in the surrounding community.</p>

              <p>Our purpose as an Asian-oriented fraternity is to bring knowledge and awareness of various Asian cultures and society to the college campuses and surrounding communities while instilling the values of loyalty and brotherhood in our hearts.</p>

              <p>We strive for perfection and excellence, and with professionalism in everything we do.</p>

              <p>Being a social/cultural fraternity brings us the opportunity to not only educate but provide entertainment and hold events for the student body and surrounding community.</p>

              <p>We shall not discriminate upon bases of race or ethnicity.</p>

              <p>We will introduce the Greek system to the Asian community on various college campuses on the East Coast.</p>

              <p>We struggle to bring Unity and recognition to the Asian community and work w/ various other Asian Greek Organizations such as, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Pi Delta Psi, alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Kappa Phi Lambda, Sigma Psi Zeta, Sigma Omicron Pi, Kappa Phi Alpha, Sigma Lambda Kappa and Psi Omega Sigma.</p>

              <p>Our goal is create a network of successful Alumnis both nationally and internationally and to become an important part of the Asian Community.</p>
